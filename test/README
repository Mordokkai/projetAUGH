This tutorial is for complete beginners with AUGH.
It is composed of:
- the main source file: idct.c
- a Makefile
- two command files for AUGH: augh-cmd-sched and augh-cmd-explo

The two command files are meant to be read by AUGH.
They contain commands for AUGH's internal command interpreter.

==========================================
Set the environment
==========================================

Make sure the environment variable PATH contains the directory where
AUGH is installed.

==========================================
Launch AUGH
==========================================

First, launch "make sched".
This launches a somewhat interactive and explained synthesis flow.

Then, launch "make explo".
This enables another flow, where AUGH automatically explores various solutions.

==========================================
Information about AUGH commands
==========================================

Have a look at the commands in the script files.

For more information about these commands, please use the internal command
interpreter. To launch it, use this command line:

	augh -i

This launched AUGH in interactive mode.
In the AUGH prompt, type 'help' for a short description of available commands.

Note 1: The command interpreter is hierarchical.
There are sub- command interpreters that correspond to modules inside AUGH.
For example, the module 'hier' enables to explore and manipulate the hierachical
graph that represents the current design. For help about commands in the
module 'hier', type 'hier help' in the AUGH prompt.

Note 2: Many commands require that a design is loaded.
The easiest way to have manual control after a design is loaded is to add
the command 'manual' after the command 'load' in one of the scripts.
This stops the execution of the script and launches the manual mode.
